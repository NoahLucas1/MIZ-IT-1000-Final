        <h1>ABOUT ME: NOAH LUCAS</h1>
        
<h3><b>Friends can be a huge part of a lot of people's lives, I know for me that is the case!</b></h3>

Me personally, I have had a lot of friends over the years as I've grown up into me becoming an adult. Some really good friends, and others that I am okay with letting go. I'm glad that I've made a lot of new friends with me starting college too!
    <br>
        <br>
Some friend that I have right now is Quincy and Logan! These are both some really great freinds that I have made in college that are always there for me watch out for me - as well as me for them.
